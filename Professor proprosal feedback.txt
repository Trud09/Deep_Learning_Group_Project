This is an interesting project. It does not seem that you are planning to implement a specific model. In this project it is important to have an implementation component and/or do extensive experimentation and analysis. The latter should also include your interpretation of results, explain why you are seeing what seeing, what you tried changing, the results etc. It is also important to spend time on devising and/or understanding the metrics you are using to evaluate your model and why they are a good choice and/or appropriate.
